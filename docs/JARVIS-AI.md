# Jarvis AI Voice Assistant User Guide

## Introduction

Jarvis AI is a voice-activated assistant that allows you to interact with your computer using natural language commands. Inspired by the JARVIS system from the Iron Man series, this application integrates various functionalities such as voice recognition, command execution, and a sci-fi user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Run the main application script:

   ```bash
   python jarvis/main.py
   ```

3. The Jarvis AI interface will appear on your screen, featuring a circular design with the text "J.A.R.V.I.S." in the center.

## Troubleshooting

If Jarvis is not responding to your commands:

1. Ensure your microphone is properly connected and functioning.
2. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.
3. Check if there's too much background noise that might interfere with voice recognition.
4. Restart the application if issues persist.

## Additional Information

- Jarvis uses the OpenWeather API for weather information. Ensure you have a valid API key set up in the configuration.
- The image generation feature uses a pre-trained model. The first generation might take some time to load the model.
- News updates are fetched using the gnewsclient library.
